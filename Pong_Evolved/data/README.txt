Missing Features:
Background music is missing as of right now. You can find the intended songs in the 
credits below.
Boss 2 in level 8 is currently not yet implemented. 
We were thinking of adding some additional levels (9, 10, 11) & an algorithm that allows for infinite levels. As of right now those two features aren’t added.
